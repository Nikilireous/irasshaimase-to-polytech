## Prologue

**Kogu Torute**: Hello, I'm the dean of this university, Kogu Torute. I heard that a student has picked three majors but can't decide on one. May I know your name?

**Player**: Hello, my name is \{player name\}. I'd appreciate your assistance.

**Kogu Torute**: Since you had trouble choosing a major when you entered, you have decided to get help from several experts who are excellent in their respective branches. You can choose one of them. They will definitely help you.

**Sugaki**: Hello, \{player name\}. My name is Sugaki, and I specialize in physics and mechanics.

**Saiba**: I'm Saiba, a computer science and cybersecurity major.

**Endgy**: My name is Endgy, and I'm a civil engineering major.

**Kogu Torute**: Each of the girls has prepared a tour of the Polytech campus, during which they will tell you in detail about their majors. This will help you make a choice at the end. Who do you want to tour with first.

**Player**: Sugaki, I guess.

### A tour with Sugaki

**Player**: Torute said that at the end of the excursions, I will know which direction suits me best. How will I find out?

**Sugaki**: It's a secret, otherwise it won't be interesting.

_"Seems like I won't be able to gather any additional information," pondered the Player._

**Sugaki**: So, first I'll show you the most important building on the Polytechnic University campus...

**Sugaki**: The dining hall.

**Player**: ...

**Player**: The most important building on the Polytechnic campus is the main building, isn't it?

**Sugaki**: Well, everyone has different interests and values. What do you think is the most important thing when studying at university?

**Player**: To pass the course with honours.

**Sugaki**: If you really think that the session is the most important part of your studies, then you are very wrong, in my opinion. After all, sessions won't help you get a job in the future.

_Player pondered._

**Sugaki**: Hello, are you there? I apologise if my reply seemed rude. But to be a successful student of physics and mechanics, it's not enough to pass a session or gain new knowledge. It is necessary to understand physics and calculus, otherwise even ordinary labs will seem something unreal to you, and there is nothing to say about the session: there is a high chance that you will be asked more than what is written in the ticket. That's why you have to understand the principle of various phenomena and not just cram.

**Player**: Nevermind. Where do we go next?

**Sugaki**: There is a scientific research building near the canteen, let's go to it.

_Sugaki and the player arrive at an exquisite, small building constructed of white tiles._

**Sugaki**: Here, in the research building, we will spend most of our time no matter which direction you choose. The classrooms are equipped with state-of-the-art technology. There are constant lectures and meetings with interesting speakers.

**Player**: I see.

_The player turns around and points to the building behind Sugaki's back._

**Player**: What's that building behind you?

**Sugaki**: Ah, that's the laboratory building. It's where the internship will take place: various laboratory and research work. By the way, do you like to do that kind of work?

**Player**: Of course, it's a great opportunity to put my knowledge to work.

**Sugaki**: That's a great attitude, you and I will work well together if you choose the physics and mechanics field.

**Sugaki**: Oh! Come quickly, I forgot to tell you about the mechanical building. It's just across from the dining hall.

_Sugaki and Player walked towards the canteen with a quick step._

**Sugaki**: Here, this building is also where you have classes and various practical work. It's bigger than a lab building, and it's home to the Department of Electrical Systems and Networks. My favourite building, ever since high school I've loved building models and studying various electrical circuits. Are you familiar with them?

**Player**: Perhaps electrical networks are one of the topics that cause me difficulties. However, if I sit and think about it and study various information, I can handle most things.

**Sugaki**: It's okay, don't worry, our teachers will help you, give you sound advice, advise you on how to do better.

**Player**: Thank you very much, Sugaki!

**Sugaki**: You're welcome! I hope to see you at our branch.

_The player walks a few metres towards the main building and sees Saiba walking towards him and waving._

### A tour with Saiba

**Saiba**: Hello, \{player's name\}! As you remember, my name is Saiba and I am a specialist in information science and cybersecurity.

**Player**: Aren't you too young to be a specialist?

**Saiba**: _blushing with resentment_ You look like a grown up boy, but you still judge a person by their looks. How unfortunate...

**Saiba**: Let's start by going round the main building. I don't think it's necessary to focus on it, because you have passed the admission committee in this picturesque building and you must have admired its interior and exterior decoration. Let's go round it and walk through the park of the Polytech University.

**Player**: Great, I love nature.

_The player and Saiba walked round the main building and came to the park path._

**Saiba**: So, why is it that one of the three choices of majors you want to study is computer science and cybersecurity? Because in order to be successful in your studies here, you need to know special programming languages and be ready to perform any task given to you: it's not enough to be able to solve USE and Olympiad problems with programming code.

**Player**: I think that I won't meet any tasks here that are more difficult than at the final stage of the USE or List Olympiad.

**Saiba**: You are very arrogant in this respect. Many students who think the same way soon drop out because they fail or fail their first session.

**Saiba**: Remember this, there are quite a lot of educational buildings, it opens up a lot of opportunities, so try to take advantage of them.

**Player**: Thank you, I'll take note of it.

_Saiba and the Player walk past the Polytechnic Museum, the Player stops and looks at the museum building._

**Player**: I heard that Polytechnic has its own museum, how dare I assume this is it? points to the red and yellow building with his hand

**Saiba**: That's a correct assumption. But it's also the building where the refresher courses are held. When you study at Polytech, you can work in parallel and improve your practical skills so that you can graduate as an expert. In my case, you can be hired as a jun or even a midle in some company if you have enough skills and experience.

_The player hesitated for a moment_

**Saiba**: Do you have any plans for that?

**Player**: I think I can combine my studies and courses or studies and part-time work. The main thing is to allocate time properly.

**Saiba**: Well, it's up to you.

**Saiba**: I think that's the end of our tour. Just remember one more thing: if you want to go further into cybersecurity and computer science, you should study maths and at least read the documentation of a couple of other programming languages. Because in the Department of Information Security and Computer Science nobody cancelled the math, and we will also be writing labs, and to avoid misunderstandings and various kinds of difficulties, you should pay even more attention to the programmes.

**Player**: Thank you very much, see you.

**Saiba**: You're welcome and see you later. Saiba Leaves in the direction of the main building.The hero walks along the road past the research building and notices Endgy sitting on a bench near the Monument to the Holy Blessings, looking at something on her laptop.

### A tour with Endgy

**Player**: Hi, I believe your name is Endgy and you're a civil engineering major?

**Endgy**: That's right, it's nice that you remembered. Sorry, I was reading and didn't hear you come up.

**Player**: That's okay. What were you reading?

**Endgy**: An article on the basics of building design.

**Player**: I've never been interested in that sort of thing, to tell you the truth.

**Endgy**: Oh! That's great! Let's discuss a couple of things instead of a tour then.

**Player**: Okay.

**Endgy**: First of all, you need to learn that a good builder is not only someone who stacks bricks and gets a house built, but also a designer with a good imagination, got it?

**Player**: Absolutely, I understand that.

**Endgy**: Good for you.

**Endgy**: And yes, don't forget that the work, or rather the models you will be doing, must be entirely your own. Otherwise there's no point in even trying to pass a session or upgrade your skills.

**Player**: That doesn't sound very good, especially since I'm not very good with imagination.

**Endgy**: Well, that's really sad.

**Player**: Thank you so much Endgy, see you around.

**Endgy**: Glad to be of service, good luck!

_The player walked around the grounds some more and met Kogu Torute, accompanied by all three specialists, near the main entrance of the Polytech University._

**Kogu Torute**: Hello again, Player. I guess now you have decided on your choice of direction.

**Player**: Yes, thanks to the girls for their help. Now I know exactly what direction I want to study.
